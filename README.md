# IRemolog: Detecting remote homolog using structure alignment algorithms and machine learning

In this repository, you will find all resource used to develop Remolog, a model for detecting remote homolog based on structure alignment data.

Description of some files:

* notebooks/remolog_pipeline.ipynb - a Colab Notebook with the remolog pipeline implemented.
* model.joblib - machine learning model to be loaded using joblib.
* data/data.csv - dataset used to train/test the machine learning model.
